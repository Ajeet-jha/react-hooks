## Rules for using React Hooks

In React, a custom Hook is a function that starts with the word “use” and may call other Hooks.
The general rules of React Hooks also apply to custom Hooks; these include:

- Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
- Only call Hooks from React function components
- Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions
